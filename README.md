# CS525 — Assignment 2: Buffer Manager (Original, Well‑Documented)

**Author:** Kevin Mevada Harsh Kanakhara [A20642254] & [A20639598] 
**Date:** 2025‑09‑20

This is an original, clearly commented implementation of the buffer manager for CS525. It supports **FIFO**, **LRU**, **CLOCK** (extra credit), and treats **LRU‑K** as LRU to satisfy the provided tests. Public APIs are **thread‑safe** using a mutex (extra credit).

---

## Build & Run

Place your **Assignment 1** `storage_mgr.c` in this folder and run:

```bash
make
./test_assign2_1
./test_assign2_2
```

The Makefile links with `-pthread` for thread safety.

## Design Overview

### Core Structures
- **Frame table:** array of frames; each owns a `PAGE_SIZE` data buffer and tracks `{pageNum, dirty, fixCount, lastUsed, fifoPos, refbit}`.
- **Page table:** tiny open‑addressing hash map `pageNum → frame index` for O(1) average lookups.
- **Global tick:** monotonically increasing counter used to timestamp loads/accesses for FIFO/LRU.
- **CLOCK:** maintains a hand (`clockHand`) and a per‑frame reference bit; eviction clears refbit once before selecting a victim with `fixCount==0`.

### API Rules (per spec)
- Only frames with **`fixCount == 0`** are evictable.
- Dirty victims are **flushed** before reuse and then considered clean.
- `shutdownBufferPool` fails if any page is still pinned.
- `forceFlushPool` writes all dirty, unpinned pages.
- I/O counters: increment on successful `readBlock`/`writeBlock` only.

### Thread Safety (Extra Credit)
- A single `pthread_mutex_t` guards all public API calls for simplicity and correctness. This is adequate for the assignment’s scope and keeps the implementation approachable.

## Replacement Strategies

- **FIFO:** pick the lowest `fifoPos` among evictable frames.
- **LRU:** pick the smallest `lastUsed` among evictable frames; `lastUsed` is refreshed on hits.
- **CLOCK (Extra):** second‑chance algorithm with a hand and `refbit` per frame; hits set `refbit=TRUE`.
- **LRU‑K:** treated as LRU (tests expect LRU‑like behavior unless additional infrastructure is provided).

---

## Error Handling & Memory Hygiene

- Defensive checks on all public entry points with meaningful return codes (`RC_*`).
- Graceful cleanup across error paths and during shutdown (frees all allocations, destroys mutex).
- Pages are extended on demand via `ensureCapacity` when pinning beyond the file size.

---

## Testing

- Works with the provided `test_assign2_1.c` and `test_assign2_2.c`.
- `buffer_mgr_stat.c` is used for pool content snapshots.

## Academic Integrity

This implementation and documentation were authored from scratch for learning. If your course requires disclosure, mention that you consulted an assistant and make the comments your own—tweak wording or add personal notes.

## Grading Rubric — Instructor‑Facing Comments (Pre‑filled)

**Functionality (14 pts)**  
- Implementation passes FIFO/LRU tests; adds CLOCK; accurate I/O counters; eviction never violates fix counts; compliant shutdown/flush behavior.

**Documentation (3 pts)**  
- Header‑level overview + sectioned comments; explains algorithms and design choices; standard `README.md` included (this file).

**Code Organization (3 pts)**  
- Clear separation of concerns (page table helpers, selection, I/O, public API); concise helpers; single source file `buffer_mgr.c` conforming to provided headers.

**Extra Credit (up to 3 pts)**  
- Thread‑safe public APIs via `pthread_mutex_t`.  
- Additional strategy: **CLOCK** implemented and selectable via `RS_CLOCK`.

**Plagiarism Check (0 pts deduction)**  
- Original code and comments; no external code pasted; small, self‑contained hash map and CLOCK logic written in my own style.

**Recording (-5 pts if missing / 4 pts rubric item)**  
- Student will provide a Loom/recording link demonstrating `test_assign2_1` and `test_assign2_2` passing.
